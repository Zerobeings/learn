# Guide
The guide will demonstrate all the functions utilized through the Market gm ‚òïÔ∏è user interface. There are additional functions that can be explored by reviewing the smart contract [0xe6342bf304bac1064b96e71e5343a90fef332dd0](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xe6342bf304bac1064b96e71e5343a90fef332dd0#code). In the case of creating a listing and submitting an offer multiple smart contract interactions will occur. These two scenarios require two transactions to complete the function. The details are outlined in their respective sections.

## Create Direct Listing
> Description from the [thirdWeb portal](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)
>
>Direct listings are low commitment, high-frequency listings; people constantly list and de-list their NFTs based on market trends. So, the listed NFTs and offer amounts are not escrowed in the Marketplace to keep the seller's NFTs and the buyer's currency liquid.
>
>This allows users to list NFTs for sale just by signing an approval; giving them the freedom to list the same NFT in multiple marketplaces, e.g. this Marketplace contract, OpenSea, etc. at the same time.
>
>Key elements of a direct listing:
>
> * Sellers list their NFT for direct sale with the price users can buy it for.
> * The NFT remains in your wallet, but you provide permission for the marketplace contract to move the NFT.
> * If a user pays the asking price, the NFT will be transferred to them, and the seller will receive the funds.
> * Users can make offers below the asking price, and the listing can have multiple offers. The seller can choose to accept an offer at any time.

To create a listing two transactions must occur. The first transaction gives permission to the marketplace contract to transfer your NFT upon sale. The first transaction is an approval function on the collection smart contract. The second transaction approves creation of the listing on the marketplace contract at the listing price specified in the listing form. All direct listings are for a duration of 7 days.

Connect, select "Direct", approve access to and transfer of your NFT to be listed, and approve listing of the NFT.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/createlisting.gif">
</p>

## Seller

### Accept a Direct Listing Offer
If you would like to accept an offer for a directlistings. Navigate to the My Listings page and then to the My Listings Panel. Select the NFT you would like to accept an offer on. Connect your wallet and an "accept" button will appear. Click "accept" to accept the offer from the offering wallet address.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/acceptanoffer.gif">
</p>

### Cancel Direct Listing
To cancel a direct listing first a wallet must be connect and secondly a cancel transaction must be approved. Only listings created by the wallet address that owns the NFT will be displayed.

> Click "cancel" on the NFT listing you would like to cancel. Connect wallet & approve cancel transaction.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/cancelisting.gif">
</p>

## Buyer
### Submit an Offer on Direct Listing 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Once an offer is made it can not be cancelled.

If you would like to offer a price lower than the listed price, input the desired offer amount and click "Make Offer". You will need to approve two transactions. The frist transaction will be to approve the WETH spending limit. This limit matches the amount of the proposed offer. Once the spend limit is approved, the offer transaction must be approved to complete the offer. All offers will be be populated in the "Offers"/"i want that" section of the NFT details panel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/offerdirectlistings.gif">
</p>

### Buy at Listed Price
If you would like to purchase the NFT at the listed price, click the "Buy" button and approve the buy transaction.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/buydirectlisting.gif">
</p>

## Create Auction
> Description from the [thirdWeb portal](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)
>
>Auction listings are high commitment, low-frequency listings. The seller and bidders respect the auction window, and recognize that their NFTs / bid amounts will be illiquid for the auction duration, and expect a guaranteed payout at auction closing ‚Äî the auctioned items for the bidder, and the winning bid amount for the seller.
>
>Both the NFTs that are listed for sale in an auction and the highest bid at any given moment are escrowed in the market.
>
>Key elements of an auction listing:
>
>* Sellers list their NFT for auction with a minimum asking price.
>* The NFT is transferred to escrow in the marketplace contract until the auction is canceled or finished.
>* Other users can place bids until the auction is closed.
>* Users can only make a bid if it is higher than the current highest bid (or asking price if there are no bids). Once made, bids cannot be withdrawn, and the auction contract holds the funds in escrow.
>* At the end of the auction, no more bids can be placed.
>* At the end of the auction, the ```closeAuction``` function needs to be called twice; once for the buyer and once for the seller.

‚ö†Ô∏è Take caution when creating an auction as the buyer and seller must close the auction. As a seller, it would be prudent to save the address of the winning bid to attempt reaching out to wallet owner.

To initiate an auction two transactions must occur. The first transaction transfers the NFT being put for auction to escrow in the marketplace contract. The second transaction passes the NFT to be auctioned and the auction parameters. The auction form requires the NFT collection address, NFT token ID, the Sale Price in ETH (buyout price), and the reserve price (minimum initial bid).

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/createauction.gif">
</p>

After bids are received for an auction the listing details page will display the bids received.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="60%" src="images/bidsindetailview.png">
</p>

## Bid on Auctioned NFT
> Winning bid can be placed within 60 seconds of the auction closing.

To bid on an auction NFT click on the NFT beings auctioned from the Available Listings panel on the Market gm ‚òïÔ∏è home page. You will be directed to a detail view of the listing page. Review the listing details. Near the bottom of the listing detail panel there is a section titled "i want that". Click the connect button to connect to the marketplace contract and reveal two purchasing options. The first option is to buyout the NFT. The buyout price is in the listing destils. The second option is to place a bid on the NFT. If you are the first person to bid, your bid price must meet the reserve price (minimum bid amount). If there are other bids, they will be listed under the "i want that" title and your bid must be 5% higher than the highest bid. The bid duration is equal to the time left until auction has ended.

> Reminder, if you are the winning bid you must close the auction at the end of the sale duration to complete the transaction and transfer of the NFT into you wallet.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/submittingbid.gif">
</p>

After you have placed a bid on an NFT a My Bids panel will be generated on the My Listings page. If you place multiple bids on a single NFT, all bids will be displayed.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/myBidspanel.png">
</p>

## Close Auction
When an auction is created the default auction duration is 7 days. Any bid submitted will expire at the end of the auction.

> At the end of the auction, the ```closeAuction``` function needs to be called twice; once for the buyer and once for the seller. [thirdWeb portal](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)

### Seller
When the seller is ready to close the auction, the seller wallet address must navigate to the My Listings page. Navigate to NFT being auctioned under the My Listings panel and click "Close Auction" located under the NFT being auctioned. In this example, test #4 is the NFT with the "Close Auction" option.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/sellercloseauction.png">
</p>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is recomended to take record of the highest bidders address prior to closing the auction.

Once the close auction function is initiated. You will be asked to connect your wallet and then submit the transaction to close the auction. After the auction is closed the NFT will no longer be available on your listings panel. 

### Buyer
At the close of the auction a Close Auction button will appear below you bids. If you held the winning bid, you click the Close Auction button under the winning bid in the My Bids Panel. All bids will be displayed in the My Bids panel. If you are in a bidding war for an NFT, all bids placed for that NFT will be listed here.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/myBidspanelCloseAuction.png">
</p>

In this example, you will click on the Close Auction button below the bid for 0.003 GOR.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="33%" src="images/closeauctionimg.png">
</p>

## Buyout auction
If you would prefer to buyout the auction, you can do so by clicking the "Buyout" button. First search the NFT collection of interest, locate the NFT that is available for auction. Click on the "Place Bid" button. You will be navigated to the listings detail page. Review the details of the NFT and the buyout price displayed in the detail view. Navigate to the "i want that" section, then connect your wallet. Click "Buyout" to initiate the buy fuction to buyout the auction.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

# Metadata Structure
It is recommended to follow the metadata structure standard developed by [opensea](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards) with two additional items: file and filetype. This will simplify the marketplace sort function when listing non-image based NFTs. It enables to the ability for future file type rendering as well.

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Example NFT #1",
    "description": "2023 Test NFT",
    "image": "ipfs://qwe.../00001.png",
    "external_url": "https://yourdomain.com/1",
    "file": "ipfs://qwe.../00001.png",
    "filetype": "png",
    "attributes": [
        {
            "trait_type": "T-Shirt",
            "value": "Blue"
        },
        {
            "trait_type": "Background",
            "value": "Stars"
        }
    ]
}
```
# goerli-market
The goerli-market aspect of the website has some limitations as compared to the mainnet pages.
The limitations are commented in server.js and are as follows:

* Alchemy API does not currently support `summarizeNFTAttributes` on the goerli testnet api.
* Alchemy API does not currently support `getFloorPrice` on the goerli testnet api.
* Alchemy API does not currently support `reingestContract` on the goerli testnet api.

These limitations also prevent a total supply for a collection from beings retrived. If the collection exceeds 100, the collection items will be displayed as `+100` in the "Collection View" panel on the home page and enough pages will be calculated for a collectin of 10,000 NFTs.

# Marketplace Repo
This marketplace repository can be found at the Zero Beings github page. 

## Repo Quickstart
Follow the guide below to get started on your own NFT marketplace today!

### Prerequisites
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation
> üö® [Wallet Connect](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal-vanilla-js-example) recommends only running the modal on https. HTTPS setup instructions can be found on the Wallet Connect github repo.

> üö® Wallet Connect recently depreciated v1.0. Next step is to upgrade the connect functionality for Market gm .

1. Fork the project.
2. Clone the project.
3. Navigate to the project directory `cd zerb-nft-marketplace`.
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
5. Run `node server` (üö® not recommended by Wallet Connect).

### Making it your Own
1. Change the NFT gating contract and user name.
2. Deploy your own thirdweb goerli marketplace [contract](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/contracts). 
3. Deploy your own thirdweb mainnet marketplace [contract](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/contracts).
4. Update the marketplace contract address.

#### Change the NFT Gate

> A complete guide can be found at Skograd's [PrivateParty](https://privateparty.dev)

You will first need to update the private party authorization. Below is the current server authorization with a user `'zerb'`, contract name `zerb`, a contract address `'0x8FbA3ebe77D3371406a77EEaf40c89C1Ed55364a'`, and a balance call function

```javascript
let balance = await contracts.zerb.methods.balanceOf(account).call()`
```

```javascript
party.add('zerb', {
  contracts: {
    zerb: {
      address: '0x8FbA3ebe77D3371406a77EEaf40c89C1Ed55364a', //for zero beings 
      rpc: process.env.RPC,
      abi: party.abi.erc721,
    },
  },
  authorize: async (req, account, contracts) => {
    let balance = await contracts.zerb.methods.balanceOf(account).call();
    if (balance > 0) return { balance: balance };
    else
      throw new Error(
        "You must own at least one 'Zero Being' mint at https://mint.zerobeings.xyz"
      );
  },
});
```

For example, let say you would like to change the user and the NFT gate, the changes would look something like this:

```javascript
party.add('user', {
  contracts: {
    mycontract: {
      address: '0x0........', //your collection address
      rpc: process.env.RPC,
      abi: party.abi.erc721,
    },
  },
  authorize: async (req, account, contracts) => {
    let balance = await contracts.mycontract.methods.balanceOf(account).call();
    if (balance > 0) return { balance: balance };
    else
      throw new Error(
        "You must own at least one 'Your NFT' mint at https://yourdomain.com"
      );
  },
});
```

#### Using Your Own Marketplace Contracts
There are total seven locations in which the goerli & mainnet contracts are explicitly used.

1. server.js
2. mbox.json
3. gbox.json
4. listingsCard.ejs (IPFS Link)
5. mybids.ejs (IPFS Link)
6. goerli-listingsCard.ejs (IPFS Link)
7. goerli-mybids.ejs (IPFS Link)
