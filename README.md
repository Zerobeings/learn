# Guide
The guide will demonstrate all the functions utilized through the Market gm ‚òïÔ∏è user interface. There are additional functions that can be explored by reviewing the smart contract [0x0000](). In the case of creating a listing and submitting an offer multiple smart contract interactions will occur. These two scenarios require two transactions to complete the function. The details are outlined in their respective sections.

## Create Direct Listing
To create a listing two transactions must occur. The first transaction gives permission to the marketplace contract to transfer your NFT upon sale. The first transaction is an approval function on the collection smart contract. The second transaction approves creation of the listing on the marketplace contract at the listing price specified in the listing form. All direct listings are for a duration of 7 days.

> Connect, select "Direct", approve access to and transfer of your NFT to be listed, and approve listing of the NFT.

<p align="center" width="100%">

> Click "cancel" on the NFT listing you would like to cancel. Connect wallet & approve cancel transaction.
