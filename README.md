# Mobile Devices

> Zerb gm ‚òïÔ∏è is set up to function as a progressive web application (A2HS). Zerb gm ‚òïÔ∏è is the gateway to Market gm ‚òïÔ∏è. 

The manifest.webmanifest is deployed as shown below. Adjust these parameters when customizing the marketplace with your NFT collection branding and colorsheme. This configuration will allow the webapp to be full screen when launched from the phone icon link giving the user a phone app like experience.

```html
{
    "background_color": "black",
    "description": "Zerb gm ‚òïÔ∏è",
    "display": "fullscreen",
    "icons": [
      {
        "src": "icon/zero-icon.png",
        "sizes": "192x192",
        "type": "image/png"
      }
    ],
    "name": "Zerb gm ‚òïÔ∏è",
    "short_name": "Zerb gm ‚òïÔ∏è",
    "start_url": "/login"
  }
```
## A2HS
To create the webapp link on phone's home screen go to [gm.zerobeings.xyz](https://gm.zerobeings.xyz) or your custom domain using the phone's native browser application.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="100%" src="images/pwaA2HS.png">
</p>

## User Experience
Now the webapp will have a link from the phone home screen. This gives a similar experience to a native application. Users can log in with there preferred mobile wallet. This is essentially a read-only experience. If you would like a mobile read and write experience, please use the web3 browser located in your preferred wallet application.

# Guide
The guide will demonstrate all the functions utilized through the Market gm ‚òïÔ∏è user interface. There are additional functions that can be explored by reviewing the testnet smart [contract](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xC65CE759f006928451343874538A328dFcbAD325#code). In the case of creating a listing and submitting an offer multiple smart contract interactions will occur. These two scenarios require two transactions to complete the function. The details are outlined in their respective sections.

## Create Direct Listing
> Description from the [thirdWeb portal](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)
>
>Direct listings are low commitment, high-frequency listings; people constantly list and de-list their NFTs based on market trends. So, the listed NFTs and offer amounts are not escrowed in the Marketplace to keep the seller's NFTs and the buyer's currency liquid.
>
>This allows users to list NFTs for sale just by signing an approval; giving them the freedom to list the same NFT in multiple marketplaces, e.g. this Marketplace contract, OpenSea, etc. at the same time.
>
>Key elements of a direct listing:
>
> * Sellers list their NFT for direct sale with the price users can buy it for.
> * The NFT remains in your wallet, but you provide permission for the marketplace contract to move the NFT.
> * If a user pays the asking price, the NFT will be transferred to them, and the seller will receive the funds.
> * Users can make offers below the asking price, and the listing can have multiple offers. The seller can choose to accept an offer at any time.

### First Time Listing for Collection
To create a listing for a collection for the first time two transactions must occur. The first transaction gives permission to the marketplace contract to transfer your NFT upon sale. The first transaction is an approval function on the collection smart contract. The second transaction approves creation of the listing on the marketplace contract at the listing price specified in the listing form. All direct listings are for a duration of 7 days.

Connect, select "Direct", approve access to and transfer of your NFT to be listed, and approve listing of the NFT.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/createlisting.gif">
</p>

### Subsequent Listings for Collection
A check is performed to determine if permission to NFT collection has been given for your wallet address. If this check returns true, then only one transaction is required to create the listing. This transaction approves creation of the listing on the marketplace contract at the listing price specified in the listing form. All direct listings are for a duration of 7 days.

Connect, select "Direct", approve listing of the NFT.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/approvedcreatelisting.gif">
</p>

## Seller

### Accept a Direct Listing Offer
If you would like to accept an offer for a directlistings. Navigate to the My Listings page and then to the My Listings Panel. Select the NFT you would like to accept an offer on. Connect your wallet and an "accept" button will appear. Click "accept" to accept the offer from the offering wallet address.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/acceptanoffer.gif">
</p>

### Cancel Direct Listing
To cancel a direct listing first a wallet must be connect and secondly a cancel transaction must be approved. Only listings created by the wallet address that owns the NFT will be displayed.

> Click "cancel" on the NFT listing you would like to cancel. Connect wallet & approve cancel transaction.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/cancelisting.gif">
</p>

## Buyer
### Submit an Offer on Direct Listing 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Once an offer is made it can not be cancelled.
> All offers are for the entire sales period of the NFT. For example, if there are 6 days left on sale, then offer duraction will be 6 days.

If you would like to offer a price lower than the listed price, input the desired offer amount and click "Make Offer". You will need to approve two transactions. The frist transaction will be to approve the WETH spending limit. This limit matches the amount of the proposed offer. Once the spend limit is approved, the offer transaction must be approved to complete the offer. All offers will be be populated in the "Offers"/"i want that" section of the NFT details panel.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/offerdirectlistings.gif">
</p>

### Buy at Listed Price
If you would like to purchase the NFT at the listed price, click the "Buy" button and approve the buy transaction.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/buydirectlisting.gif">
</p>

## Create Auction
> Description from the [thirdWeb portal](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)
>
>Auction listings are high commitment, low-frequency listings. The seller and bidders respect the auction window, and recognize that their NFTs / bid amounts will be illiquid for the auction duration, and expect a guaranteed payout at auction closing ‚Äî the auctioned items for the bidder, and the winning bid amount for the seller.
>
>Both the NFTs that are listed for sale in an auction and the highest bid at any given moment are escrowed in the market.
>
>Key elements of an auction listing:
>
>* Sellers list their NFT for auction with a minimum asking price.
>* The NFT is transferred to escrow in the marketplace contract until the auction is canceled or finished.
>* Other users can place bids until the auction is closed.
>* Users can only make a bid if it is higher than the current highest bid (or asking price if there are no bids). Once made, bids cannot be withdrawn, and the auction contract holds the funds in escrow.
>* At the end of the auction, no more bids can be placed.
>* At the end of the auction, the ```closeAuction``` function needs to be called twice; once for the buyer and once for the seller.

‚ö†Ô∏è Take caution when creating an auction as the buyer and seller must close the auction. As a seller, it would be prudent to save the address of the winning bid to attempt reaching out to wallet owner.

To initiate an auction two transactions must occur. The first transaction transfers the NFT being put for auction to escrow in the marketplace contract. The second transaction passes the NFT to be auctioned and the auction parameters. The auction form requires the NFT collection address, NFT token ID, the Sale Price in ETH (buyout price), and the reserve price (minimum initial bid).

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/createauction.gif">
</p>

After bids are received for an auction the listing details page will display the bids received.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="60%" src="images/bidsindetailview.png">
</p>

## Bid on Auctioned NFT
> Winning bid can be placed within 60 seconds of the auction closing.

To bid on an auction NFT click on the NFT beings auctioned from the Available Listings panel on the Market gm ‚òïÔ∏è home page. You will be directed to a detail view of the listing page. Review the listing details. Near the bottom of the listing detail panel there is a section titled "i want that". Click the connect button to connect to the marketplace contract and reveal two purchasing options. The first option is to buyout the NFT. The buyout price is in the listing destils. The second option is to place a bid on the NFT. If you are the first person to bid, your bid price must meet the reserve price (minimum bid amount). If there are other bids, they will be listed under the "i want that" title and your bid must be 5% higher than the highest bid. The bid duration is equal to the time left until auction has ended.

> Reminder, if you are the winning bid you must close the auction at the end of the sale duration to complete the transaction and transfer of the NFT into you wallet.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/submittingbid.gif">
</p>

After you have placed a bid on an NFT a My Bids panel will be generated on the My Listings page. If you place multiple bids on a single NFT, all bids will be displayed.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/myBidspanel.png">
</p>

## Close Auction
When an auction is created the default auction duration is 7 days. Any bid submitted will expire at the end of the auction.

> At the end of the auction, the ```closeAuction``` function needs to be called twice; once for the buyer and once for the seller. [thirdWeb portal](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)

### Seller
When the seller is ready to close the auction, the seller wallet address must navigate to the My Listings page. Navigate to NFT being auctioned under the My Listings panel and click "Close Auction" located under the NFT being auctioned. In this example, test #4 is the NFT with the "Close Auction" option.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/sellercloseauction.png">
</p>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is recomended to take record of the highest bidders address prior to closing the auction.

Once the close auction function is initiated. You will be asked to connect your wallet and then submit the transaction to close the auction. After the auction is closed the NFT will no longer be available on your listings panel. 

### Buyer
At the close of the auction a Close Auction button will appear below you bids. If you held the winning bid, you click the Close Auction button under the winning bid in the My Bids Panel. All bids will be displayed in the My Bids panel. If you are in a bidding war for an NFT, all bids placed for that NFT will be listed here.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="images/myBidspanelCloseAuction.png">
</p>

In this example, you will click on the Close Auction button below the bid for 0.003 GOR.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="33%" src="images/closeauctionimg.png">
</p>

## Buyout auction
If you would prefer to buyout the auction, you can do so by clicking the "Buyout" button. First search the NFT collection of interest, locate the NFT that is available for auction. Click on the "Place Bid" button. You will be navigated to the listings detail page. Review the details of the NFT and the buyout price displayed in the detail view. Navigate to the "i want that" section, then connect your wallet. Click "Buyout" to initiate the buy fuction to buyout the auction.

# Metadata Structure
It is recommended to follow the metadata structure standard developed by [opensea](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards) with three additional items: file, filetype, and liscense url.

The file and filetype will simplify the marketplace sort function when listing non-image based NFTs. It enables to the ability for future file type rendering as well.

The liscense url is designed to take a step in supporting the proposed [Ricardian Royalty Standard](https://ricardian.factoria.app/#/)

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Example NFT #1",
    "description": "2023 Test NFT",
    "image": "ipfs://qwe.../00001.png",
    "external_url": "https://yourdomain.com/1",
    "file": "https://<CID>.ipfs.nftstorage.link/04321.doc",
    "filetype": "png",
    "license_url": "https://<CID>.ipfs.nftstorage.link/04321.txt",
    "attributes": [
        {
            "trait_type": "T-Shirt",
            "value": "Blue"
        },
        {
            "trait_type": "Background",
            "value": "Stars"
        }
    ]
}
```

If your metadata contains these elements, the NFTs in your collection will contain two additional icons. These icons are links to the file or the license_url.
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="60%" src="images/file_license.png">
</p>

# goerli-market
The goerli-market aspect of the website has some limitations as compared to the mainnet pages.
The limitations are commented in server.js and are as follows:

* Alchemy API does not currently support `summarizeNFTAttributes` on the goerli testnet api.
* Alchemy API does not currently support `getFloorPrice` on the goerli testnet api.
* Alchemy API does not currently support `reingestContract` on the goerli testnet api.

These limitations also prevent a total supply for a collection from beings retrived. If the collection exceeds 100, the collection items will be displayed as `+100` in the "Collection View" panel on the home page and enough pages will be calculated for a collectin of 10,000 NFTs.

## goerli Test Collections
> More test collections will be created to test various rendering scenarios.

* Image based Collection (goerli) Test_Warp. Mint a Test_Warp [here](https://open.factoria.app/mint/#0x9870Da00643AeA2BE9dF89d87efeD0A2fdb5479e)

# Marketplace Repo
This marketplace repository can be found at the Zero Beings github page. Link coming soon...

## Repo Quickstart
Follow the guide below to get started on your own NFT marketplace today! Otherwise you can [mint](mint.zerobeings.xyz) a Zero Being and start using [Market gm ‚òïÔ∏è](gm.zerobeings.xyz) today!

### Prerequisites
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation
> üö® Wallet Connect recommends only running the modal on https. Tools like [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) can be used to accomplish this.
>
> Recently Wallet Connect began the process of sunsetting the Web3Modal V1.0. However, you can still use this modal by upgrading the WalletConnect ethereum-provider to v2.0. This was done for Market gm.

```
For Web3Modal v1.0 integrations
We recommend that you replace your existing integration with the latest version of Web3Modal, for which you can find more docs here.

If you still want to use Web3Modal v1.0 but just upgrade the WalletConnect ethereum-provider to v2.0 then you can update to the latest version available on NPM which you can find here.
```

1. Fork the project.
2. Clone the project.
3. Navigate to the project directory `cd zerb-nft-marketplace`.
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
5. Run `node server` (üö® not recommended by Wallet Connect) or set up a [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) (recommended).

### Making it your Own
1. Change the NFT gating contract and user name.
2. Deploy your own thirdweb goerli marketplace [contract](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/contracts). 
3. Deploy your own thirdweb mainnet marketplace [contract](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/contracts).
4. Update the marketplace contract address.
5. Update the mbox.json and gbox.json files.
6. Update `session.zerb.account` to new user reference throughout repository.

#### Change the NFT Gate

> A complete guide can be found at Skograd's [PrivateParty](https://privateparty.dev)

You will first need to update the private party authorization. Below is the current server authorization with a user `'zerb'`, contract name `zerb`, a contract address `'0x8FbA3ebe77D3371406a77EEaf40c89C1Ed55364a'`, and a balance call function

```javascript
let balance = await contracts.zerb.methods.balanceOf(account).call()
```

```javascript
party.add('zerb', {
  contracts: {
    zerb: {
      address: '0x8FbA3ebe77D3371406a77EEaf40c89C1Ed55364a', //for zero beings 
      rpc: process.env.RPC,
      abi: party.abi.erc721,
    },
  },
  authorize: async (req, account, contracts) => {
    let balance = await contracts.zerb.methods.balanceOf(account).call();
    if (balance > 0) return { balance: balance };
    else
      throw new Error(
        "You must own at least one 'Zero Being' mint at https://mint.zerobeings.xyz"
      );
  },
});
```

For example, let say you would like to change the user and the NFT gate, the changes would look something like this:

```javascript
party.add('user', {
  contracts: {
    mycontract: {
      address: '0x0........', //your collection address
      rpc: process.env.RPC,
      abi: party.abi.erc721,
    },
  },
  authorize: async (req, account, contracts) => {
    let balance = await contracts.mycontract.methods.balanceOf(account).call();
    if (balance > 0) return { balance: balance };
    else
      throw new Error(
        "You must own at least one 'Your NFT' mint at https://yourdomain.com"
      );
  },
});
```

#### Using Your Own Marketplace Contracts
There are total seven locations in which the goerli & mainnet contract addresses are explicitly used.

1. server.js
2. mbox.json
3. gbox.json
4. listingsCard.ejs (IPFS Link)
5. goerli-listingsCard.ejs (IPFS Link)

#### Update server.js

```javascript
// Marketplace contracts
// contracts are referenced in three locations in mbox.json for mainnet and gbox.json for goerli,
// the listingsCard and mybids for mainnet and goerli-listingsCard & goerli-mybids in the IPFS site link,
// in the const listed below, and finally the marketfooter files.
const gMarkectContract = '<your goerli contract address>'; //goerli marketplace contract. Deploy from thirdweb dashboard.
const mainnetMarketContract = '<your mainnet contract address>'; //ETH mainnet marketplace contract. Deploy from thirdweb dashboard
```

#### Updating mbox.json and gbox.json files
You will need to add your contract address and [projectId](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-up) to the mbox.json and gbox.json files to establish a wallet connection.

The mbox.json file supports the connection to the mainnet.
```json
{"contract":"<MarketContract>","network":"main","projectId":"<projectID from WalletConnect Cloud>"}
```

The gbox.json file supports the connection to the goerli-network.

```json
{"contract":"<MarketContract>","network":"goerli","projectId":"<projectID from WalletConnect Cloud>"}
```

#### Update the listingCard partials
